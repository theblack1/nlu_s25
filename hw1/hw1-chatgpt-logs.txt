Q：briefly tell me: what is @classmethod in a python class, and what is its different compare to normal method?
A：In Python, @classmethod is a decorator used to define a class method. A class method receives the class itself (cls) as its first parameter instead of an instance (self), which allows it to access and modify class-level attributes rather than instance-level attributes.

Differences from a Normal Method:
First Parameter:

Normal Method: Takes self as the first parameter (instance-level).
Class Method: Takes cls as the first parameter (class-level).
Access Scope:

Normal Method: Can modify instance attributes and call other instance methods.
Class Method: Can modify class attributes but cannot access or modify specific instance attributes unless explicitly passed.
Usage:

Normal Method: Used for operations related to a specific instance.
Class Method: Used for operations that affect the whole class or create alternative constructors.
Example:
class Example:
    class_attr = "I am a class attribute"

    def normal_method(self):
        return f"Called from {self}"

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        return f"Class method called from {cls}, class_attr: {cls.class_attr}"

# Usage:
obj = Example()
print(obj.normal_method())  # Works on instance
print(Example.class_method())  # Works on class itself
In summary, @classmethod allows operations at the class level, while normal methods work on individual instances.

Q：Briefly tell me: How to use np.fromstring?
A：np.fromstring is a NumPy function used to create a NumPy array from a string containing numerical data. It is useful for parsing text-based numerical data into an array.

Syntax:
np.fromstring(string, dtype=float, sep=' ')
Parameters:
string: The input string containing numeric values.
dtype: The desired data type of the resulting array (default is float).
sep: The separator between numbers in the string (default is a space ' ').
Example Usage:
import numpy as np

data = "1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5"
arr = np.fromstring(data, dtype=float, sep=' ')
print(arr)  # Output: [1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5]
Important Notes:
The sep argument must be specified for space-separated strings.
If sep is an empty string (''), np.fromstring expects binary data instead of text.
If the string format is incorrect, it may return an empty array.
